Alright, let's begin by approaching this machine learning project systematically. Here is a general roadmap that we'll follow:

- Data Exploration:
- Load the dataset.
- Visualize the data to understand its distribution and characteristics.
    - Check for any missing values and decide on a strategy to handle them.
- Data Pre-processing:
    - Split the data into training and test sets.
    - Standardize or normalize the features if necessary.
- Modeling:
    - Initial Model: Start with a simple linear regression as it's interpretable and provides a good baseline.
- Model Evaluation: Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the model's performance.
    - Iterative Improvement: Depending on the results from the initial model, we might consider more complex models.

    - Discuss potential ways the model can be deployed in a real-world clinical setting.
- Let's get started with the first step: Data Exploration.

--------------------------------------

Great! Now that we have the data loaded properly, we can see the four columns:

colesterol_total: Total cholesterol levels.
idade: Age of the patient.
glicemia: Blood glucose levels.
desfecho: Outcome (1 if infarction occurred within 120 days after the examination, -1 otherwise).
1.2 Data Characteristics:
We'll now generate some basic statistics and visualizations to understand the data distribution and characteristics. This will help us identify patterns, outliers, and any potential issues.

--------------------------------------

Total Cholesterol: Appears to be normally distributed with a slight skew to the right. Most values are clustered around the 200 mark, which is a typical average total cholesterol level for adults.
Age: There's a wide range of ages, with most of the patients being between 20 and 80. It appears to be somewhat uniformly distributed.
Blood Glucose: The distribution is somewhat right-skewed, with most patients having glucose levels below 150.
Next, let's check for any missing values in the dataset. Missing data can lead to biased or incorrect model results, so it's crucial to identify and decide how to handle them.

--------------------------------------

It's great news that there are no missing values in the dataset. This makes the preprocessing step easier and more straightforward.

Step 2: Data Pre-processing
2.1 Splitting the Data
Before we proceed with modeling, we need to split the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train our model, while the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

We'll use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. Let's do that now.

The data has been successfully split into training and test sets:

Training set: 420 samples
Test set: 180 samples
2.2 Standardization:
Given that machine learning models, especially linear models, are sensitive to the scale of input features, it's a good practice to standardize the features. This means that we'll transform the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Standardizing the data can improve the performance and stability of our model. Let's go ahead and standardize the training and test data.

The training data has been successfully standardized. The transformed values now have a mean close to 0 and a standard deviation close to 1.

Step 3: Modeling
3.1 Initial Model - Linear Regression
Given that our target variable is binary (1 for infarction and -1 otherwise), a simple linear regression might not be the best choice for classification. However, as per the instructions, we'll start with it to establish a baseline.

Once we have the results from the linear regression, we can evaluate its performance and then consider alternative models if needed.

Let's train a linear regression model using the scaled training data.

The mean squared error (MSE) for our linear regression model on the test set is approximately 
0.6905
0.6905. MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values, with a lower value indicating a better fit.

However, while MSE provides some insight into the model's performance, it's not the most appropriate metric for classification tasks. We should also evaluate the model using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score.

Given the continuous output from the linear regression model, we'll need to set a threshold to classify each prediction as either 1 (infarction) or -1 (no infarction). A common approach is to use 0 as the threshold: values above 0 are classified as 1, and those below 0 are classified as -1.

Let's calculate these classification metrics using a threshold of 0.

Here's how our simple linear regression model performed on the test set when using a threshold of 0:

Accuracy: Approximately 75.56%
Precision (for infarction): 74%
Recall (for infarction): 48%
F1-Score (for infarction): 58%

Here's how our simple linear regression model performed on the test set when using a threshold of 0:

Accuracy: Approximately 75.56%
Precision (for infarction): 74%
Recall (for infarction): 48%
F1-Score (for infarction): 58%
While the accuracy is decent for a simple linear model, the recall for infarction cases is relatively low at 48%. This means that the model is missing over half of the actual infarction cases. In a clinical setting, this could be problematic since failing to identify potential heart attack risks could have severe consequences.


Step 3.2 Iterative Improvement
Given the results from our simple linear regression model, it's evident that we might benefit from considering more sophisticated models tailored for classification tasks, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or ensemble methods.

However, since the initial instruction was to start with linear regression, we can try logistic regression next as a natural progression. Logistic regression is specifically designed for binary classification tasks and might offer better performance in this context.

Let's train a logistic regression model using the scaled training data.

Here's how the logistic regression model performed on the test set:

Accuracy: Approximately 76.11%
Precision (for infarction): 73%
Recall (for infarction): 52%
F1-Score (for infarction): 61%
The logistic regression model shows a slight improvement over the linear regression model, especially in terms of recall for infarction cases, which has increased to 52%. However, there's still room for improvement, especially considering the importance of correctly identifying potential heart attack risks.

Step 4: Model Interpretation
Given the nature of our problem, understanding the importance of each feature can provide valuable insights for clinicians. Let's interpret the logistic regression model by looking at the coefficients of each feature. These coefficients can give us an idea about the relative importance of each feature in predicting the outcome.

1. Data Exploration:

We loaded the data and identified four columns: colesterol_total, idade, glicemia, and desfecho.
Visual analysis showed a relatively normal distribution for total cholesterol, a uniform distribution for age, and a right-skewed distribution for blood glucose.
No missing values were found in the dataset.
2. Data Pre-processing:

The dataset was split into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%).
We standardized the features to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
3. Modeling:

Linear Regression: As per the instructions, we started with a simple linear regression. The accuracy achieved was approximately 75.56%. However, its recall for infarction cases was a bit low, at 48%.
Logistic Regression: As a natural progression from linear regression and given that our task is binary classification, we used logistic regression next. It showed a slight improvement with an accuracy of 76.11% and a recall for infarction cases of 52%.
4. Model Interpretation:

The logistic regression model suggested the following order of feature importance:
colesterol_total
idade (Age)
glicemia (Blood Glucose)

=> Lets plot a correlation graph.
Here's the correlation graph, which showcases the pairwise correlation between the features:

Positive values indicate a positive correlation: as one feature increases, the other also tends to increase.
Negative values indicate a negative correlation: as one feature increases, the other tends to decrease.
Values close to 1 or -1 indicate strong positive or negative correlation, respectively, while values close to 0 indicate weak or no correlation.
From the graph, we can see that none of the features have a very strong correlation with each other. This is good, as it reduces the potential for multicollinearity in our models.


Class imbalance refers to situations where some classes have significantly fewer samples compared to others. In classification tasks, a severe class imbalance can skew the model towards predicting the majority class, leading to poor performance on the minority class.

Given that our target variable is desfecho, which can take values of 1 (indicating infarction) or -1 (indicating no infarction), we'll examine the distribution of these classes.

Let's visualize the distribution of the desfecho variable to check for class imbalance.



The distribution of the target variable desfecho indicates:

There are more samples with a label of 
−
1
−1 (indicating no infarction) compared to samples with a label of 
1
1 (indicating infarction).
The dataset does exhibit some class imbalance, with the 
−
1
−1 class being more prevalent.
Class imbalance can lead to models that are biased towards predicting the majority class. As a result, the model might achieve high accuracy by mostly predicting the majority class, but it can perform poorly in identifying the minority class, which is often the more important class in many applications.

To mitigate class imbalance, various techniques can be applied, such as:

Resampling: This involves either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class to balance the class distribution.
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE): This method generates synthetic samples for the minority class.
Using different evaluation metrics: Instead of relying solely on accuracy, using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or the area under the ROC curve can provide a better understanding of model performance, especially for the minority class.
Altering the algorithm: Some algorithms allow you to assign different weights to classes, which can be useful in imbalanced datasets.

Both SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and resampling are popular techniques to address class imbalance. Let's delve into the benefits and downsides of each:

1. Resampling
Benefits:
Simplicity: Resampling techniques, whether it's oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class, are straightforward to understand and implement.
No Data Fabrication: When undersampling, you're simply reducing the majority class to balance the classes, which means you aren't introducing any new or synthetic data points.
Downsides:
Loss of Data: When you're undersampling the majority class, you're discarding potentially useful data, which can lead to loss of information and decrease model performance.
Overfitting: Oversampling the minority class, especially in cases with severe class imbalances, can lead to overfitting since it replicates the minority samples.
2. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
Benefits:
Augments Data: SMOTE creates synthetic samples in the feature space, augmenting the dataset and potentially providing more variability to the model.
Reduces Overfitting: Since SMOTE doesn't replicate instances but rather generates new samples, it's less prone to overfitting compared to simple oversampling.
Adaptable: SMOTE can be combined with undersampling of the majority class to create a balanced dataset.
Downsides:
Data Fabrication: SMOTE generates synthetic data points. While this can help in training, there's no guarantee that these points are representative of real-world data.
Increased Training Time: The augmented dataset after applying SMOTE will be larger, leading to longer training times.
Not Always Effective: In some cases, the synthetic samples generated by SMOTE can be noisy and not helpful. It's essential to evaluate the model's performance on a holdout set or using cross-validation to ensure the synthetic samples are aiding the model.
Boundary Over-extension: SMOTE can sometimes create synthetic samples that are too "optimistic," meaning they are located outside the actual data distribution, potentially leading the model to make incorrect generalizations.
Conclusion:
While both resampling and SMOTE can be beneficial in addressing class imbalance, the most appropriate technique depends on the specific dataset and problem at hand. It's often recommended to try multiple techniques and evaluate their performance using proper validation methods to find the best approach for a given scenario.

Alright, let's address the class imbalance in the dataset using both techniques:

SMOTE for generating synthetic samples for the minority class.
Resampling by oversampling the minority class and/or undersampling the majority class.

We'll then compare the performance of the models trained on the original dataset and the resampled dataset.

Here's the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the linear regression model. The curve showcases the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (sensitivity) and the False Positive Rate (1-specificity) for different threshold values.

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 
0.8335
0.8335, which indicates a good discriminatory ability of the model. An AUC value of 0.5 would mean the model is as good as random, while a value of 1.0 would mean the model is perfect.

To summarize:

The model has shown a decent performance with an accuracy of 
78.17%.
The precision, recall, and F1-scores for both classes indicate that the model is better at predicting the negative class (-1) compared to the positive class (1).
The ROC curve and its AUC value support the model's good discriminatory ability.

The top-left cell represents the True Negative Rate (TN Rate) - the proportion of actual negatives that were correctly predicted as negative.
The top-right cell shows the False Positive Rate (FP Rate) - the proportion of actual negatives that were incorrectly predicted as positive.
The bottom-left cell represents the False Negative Rate (FN Rate) - the proportion of actual positives that were incorrectly predicted as negative.
The bottom-right cell indicates the True Positive Rate (TP Rate) - the proportion of actual positives that were correctly predicted as positive.
